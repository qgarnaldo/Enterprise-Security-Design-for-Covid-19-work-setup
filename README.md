# Overview

The case study aims to test the students’ skills in network design and security. Furthermore, it  aims to: 

1. Create a simple network design topology suitable for the client’s situation. 
  a. Create network services in the topology to increase network value. 
2. Apply learned network security concepts and methods to secure designed network. 
  a. Plan risk management, vulnerability management, security device management,  and information system management to improve network security design. 
  b. Test designed network security against certain attacks to determine effectivity of the  design. 

The overall design of the topology incorporates all three floors with internet access through the  ISP, and connection to outside units that are part of the company’s domain. This is simulated in  Cisco Packet Tracer.
